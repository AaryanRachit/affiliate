That's where VPN comes to prevent hackers from stealing your data. It takes many measures to protect your data like hiding your IP address from potential hackers and provide you a secure server connections.</p>

                </ol>
            </allst>
            </steps>
            <h2 id="step1">ExpressVPN</h2>
            <section class="step">
                <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/home/1"><img src="imag1.webp" alt="ExpressVPN"></a>
                <p>The best VPN that I have tried and tested so far is <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/home/1">ExpressVPN</a>. It's because ExpressVPN has over 3100 servers across 96 countries which is a lot. You'll be surprised to hear that there was only 18% internet speed loss which very less when compared to other VPN providers. You are provided with IP address checker and 2 leak testers to check whether your password has been leaked somewhere.</p>
                <p>These were some small features that Express VPN offers but let me now tell you its core features.</p>
                <h3>Anonymous Browsing</h3>
                <p>The first core feature you get with ExpressVPN is its Anonymous browsing. The way it works is that whenever you browse the internet, ExpressVPN exempts you from logging your internet traffic or VPN connections. That means you can browse the internet anonymously, which ensures that your IP address cannot be traced back to you. It also makes sure that no one can match you with your IP address or timestamp. It has been a very useful feature for me since it has saved me so many times from getting my sensitive data stolen by hackers.</p>
                <h3>Kill Switch</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, the VPN connection drops and doesn't work. This makes you vulnerable of your data being stolen by hackers. That's where Kill Switch comes to play. It is a feature prevents your device from making unprotected connections. It's like a backup protection which gets enabled whenever your VPN connection is down. Your connection stays blocked until the tunnel to a VPN server is re-established.</p>
                <h3>Split tunneling</h3>
                <p>VPN split tunneling is a feature which allows you to allow some apps or softwares to access the internet directly or through encrypted VPN. It can be advantageous in situations where you want to benefit from services that perform best when your data (like location etc.) is known while having secure access to potentially sensitive communications and data. By using split tunneling, you can conserve bandwith and stream content without using foreign IP addresses. Just be careful of the security risks when using this.</p>
                <p>In terms of streaming, ExpressVPN allows you to watch shows and movies which are not even available in your locality while having unlimited bandwith to provide you with smooth streaming experience.</p>
                <p>The price of <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/home/1">ExpressVPN</a> is $13 if you opt-in for 1 month plan, $10/month for 6 months or $6.67/month if you buy 15 month plan (12 months + 3 months free).</p>
                <p>All-in-all, I would give ExpressVPN a rating of 9/10!</p>
            </section>
            <h2 id="step2">NordVPN</h2>
            <section class="step">
                <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=86910&url_id=902"><img src="imag2.webp" alt="NordVPN"></a>
                <p>The next best VPN provider (and my personal favourite too) is <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=86910&url_id=902">NordVPN</a>. The reason that it is my personal favourite and the second best is because you have the ability to install the VPN in your internet router. It is really cool since it allows you to connect to internet securely and privately. This makes NordVPN stand out among other VPN providers. Not only that, you also get high number of servers (over 5000 servers), a Dedicated IP add-on and an ad-blocker. Along with that, you also get an antivirus program to keep your device safe from any viruses.</p>
                <p>These were some small features that you get with NordVPN but now let's talk about its important and main features:</p>
                <h3>Dark Web Monitor</h3>
                <p>Dark Web is place on the internet where your data can be used for wrong purposes and you definitely don't want to get your data leaked to be used against you, right? That's why NordVPN has a special feature to tackle this problem. This feature is known as Dark Web Monitor which notifies you if your data is leaked to dark web so that you can take actions accordingly.</p>
                <h3>Threat Protection</h3>
                <p>Have you ever wondered that the sites you visit, the files or apps you download or any another activity you do on the internet can be tracked by someone? If you think that the answer is no, then you are totally wrong. There are hundreds of trackers who know each and every activity you do on the internet everyday without you even knowing. This way, these trackers know all the information about you which they can use against you. This is why NordVPN has a special feature called Threat Protection. The way it works is that it scans the website that you land on, identifies threats and blocks them immediately. Same goes when you download a file, it scans every aspect of the file that you're downloading and blocks any threats like malwares before they infect your device. Threat protection also blocks annoying and disruptive ads.</p>
                <h3>Split tunneling</h3>
                <p>As I discussed earlier, split tunneling is a feature that allows you to use some apps with VPN and some apps without VPN. The main advantage of this feature is that you enjoy benefits of an app that works best when your VPN is off and your data like location is known to it.</p>
                <h3>Kill Switch</h3>
                <p>As I discussed earlier in the ExpressVPN section, kill switch is feature that automatically blocks the device to access internet when the connection with you VPN drops. Kill switch is enabled until your device regains connection with the VPN. This helps eleminate potential vulnerability when you don't have a connection to VPN.</p>
                <h3>Double VPN</h3>
                <p>Double VPN, as you guessed by its name is just a feature that routes your traffic to two VPN servers instead of one to encrypt your data twice as much. It helps protect your IP, increase privacy to a point where your Internet Service Provider can't see your final destination on the web. They can only know that you're using a VPN service. Although, this feature is great, it isn't of much use to me at least. It's because I only want secure connections to websites and prevent third parties from tracking my IP. So, for this purpose Normal VPN is enough.</p>
                <h3>Meshnet</h3>
                <p>Meshnet is a feature that allows you to safely access other devices, no matter where they are. Meshnet works like a Local Area Network (LAN), which makes it suitable for activities that require low latency, high speed and advanced security, like file sharing, active work collaborations etc.</p>
                <p>NordVPN is a great choice when it comes for streaming. It's because of its high number of servers and high internet speeds, allowing you to smoothly stream content without any throttling. Just keep in mind that internet speeds may depend upon the location of the server that you're connected to and the distance between your physical location and the server.</p>
                <p>The pricing of <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=86910&url_id=902">NordVPN</a> are as follows:</p>
                <h4>Complete Plan</h4>
                <p><b>2-years plan</b>: $6.69/month</p>
                <p><b>1-year plan</b>: $7.29/month</p>
                <p><b>Monthly plan</b>: $15.69/month</p>
                <h4>Plus Plan</h4>
                <p><b>2-years plan</b>: $5.19/month</p>
                <p><b>1-year plan</b>: $5.79/month</p>
                <p><b>Monthly plan</b>: $14.19/month</p>
                <h4>Standard Plan</h4>
                <p><b>2-years plan</b>: $3.99/month</p>
                <p><b>1-year plan</b>: $4.59/month</p>
                <p><b>Monthly plan</b>: $12.99/month</p>
                <p>NordVPN also provides you with 30-days money back guarantee so that you can ask for a refund if you don't like it.</p>
                <p>All-in-all, I would give NordVPN a rating of 8/10!</p>
                </section>
                <h2 id="step3">Surfshark</h2>
                <section class="step">
                    <a href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=926&aff_id=19961"><img src="surfsharkv.jpg" alt="Surfshark VPN"></a>
                    <p>Another great VPN provider that I may recommend is <a href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=926&aff_id=19961">Surfshark</a>. It is because of its high speed and high number of servers that are spread out all around the globe, making it a competitive choice for a VPN.</p>
                    <p>The best feature Surfshark provides is that it allows you to connect to unlimited number of devices, which I didn't find in a lot of VPNs. The only con of using Surfshark is that many features are included in Surfshark one bundle which comes at a extra cost which is $7.75 a month plus taxes whereas NordVPN provides near-same features as a part of their main subscription plan. Along with that, it does not provide split tunneling on IOS.</p>
                    <p>Let's now talk about Surfshark's main features that comes with a standard plan:</p>
                    <h3>Anonymous browsing</h3>
                    <p>Just like every VPN provider, Surfshark also provides Anonymous Browsing which simply means that you can browse the internet anonymously by not logging your internet traffic or VPN connections to be safe from potential hackers.</p>
                    <h3>Split tunneling</h3>
                    <p>Split tunneling is a feature that allows you to choose which apps or websites can access the internet directly and which can access the internet through a VPN connection.</p>
                    <h3>Kill Switch</h3>
                    <p>Kill Switch is a feature that acts like a backup plan whenever your VPN drops unexpectedly. It automatically blocks your internet connection to prevent your information being exposed.</p>
                    <h3>MultiHop</h3>
                    <p>A great that Surfshark provides which most VPNs don't have is MultiHop. This feature allows you to connect to two different VPN servers at a time, which means that you can connect to a server say, Greenland and also connect to a server in Greece simultaneously. According to Surfshark, MultiHop feature can help improve your internet speed while adding an extra layer of security by hiding your real location.</p>
                    <p>A good thing about Surfshark is that it has over 5000 servers worldwide, allowing you to connect to a server in any country you want. Additionally, Surfshark has fastest average download and upload speed when compared to other VPNs, making it a good option for streaming. Keep in mind that the actual speed will depend on a number of factors which includes the server you're connected to and how far it is from your actual location.</p>
                    <p>The pricing of <a href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=926&aff_id=19961">Surfshark</a> is $12.95 if you choose one month plan, $3.99/month if you choose yearly plan and $2.39/month if you choose 25 month plan (2 years plus one month extra).</p>
                    <p>Surfshark also provides you with 30-days money back guarantee so that you ask for a refund if you don't like it.</p>
                    <p>All-in-all, I would give Surfshark a rating of 7.5/10!</p>
                </section>
                <h2 id="step4">ProtonVPN</h2>
                <section class="step">
                    <a href="https://go.getproton.me/aff_c?offer_id=26&aff_id=5186"><img src="protonvpn.jpg" alt="ProtonVPN"></a>
                    <p>The next VPN provider on the list is <a href="https://go.getproton.me/aff_c?offer_id=26&aff_id=5186">ProtonVPN</a>. It has over 2100 servers across 70 countries worldwide to help you find a high-bandwith server which you can use to prevent hackers from stealing your sensitive data that can be used against you.</p>
                    <p>ProtonVPN is well known for providing multiple layers of protection, which also includes military grade servers to keep your data extremely safe. A very good feature that protonVPN has is it's VPN accelerator, which means that you can browse the internet upto 400% faster, especially over less reliable internet connections.</p>
                    <p>The major advantage of using protonVPN is that it has a free plan which you can use to stay protected on the internet but the major drawback with the free plan is that you are allowed to connect to only 3 countres, which are USA, Netherlands and Japan. You also lack some features like Security Core, which routes your most sensitive data through the safest server that ProtonVPN has. It's paid plan, on the other hand has all the features and it also allows you to connect to more than 70 countries.</p>
                    <p>Let's now talk about ProtonVPN's core features:</p>
                    <h3>Anonymous Browsing</h3>
                    <p>The first feature that ProtonVPN offers is Anonymous Browsing. It means that you can browse the internet without logging your traffic which prevents hackers, advertisers to track your daily activities. This is done by blocking IP address so that they can only see the IP address of your chosen server.</p>
                    <h3>Kill Switch</h3>
                    <p>Kill switch acts as a backup plan which gets enabled whenever your VPN connection drops unexpectedly. What this feature does is that it blocks all the internet traffic to help your IP address stay hidden.</p>
                    <h3>DNS protection</h3>
                    <p>DNS (short for Domain Management System) is used by browsers to send requests to find the requested web page. The most dangerous thing about DNS is that it translates the domain names to IP address for your device that allows hackers and spies to detect your everyday activities. Therefore to prevent these kind of situations, ProtonVPN routes the DNS queries through its encrypted server that disallows spies, hackers etc to see what you're doing online.</p>
                    <h3>Split tunneling</h3>
                    <p>Split tunneling enables you to allow some apps to use the internet directly and allow rest of the apps to use the internet through a VPN server. The main advantage that you can get is that you can enjoy the full functionality of an app that works best when you data like location etc. This feature shall be used only when you're totally sure that it's completely safe to allow the app to directly use the internet.</p>
                    <h3>Stealth</h3>
                    <p>Stealth is a very special protocol that allows you to bypass and evade most firewalls and access uncensored sites. It hides your VPN connection from censors to make VPN traffic look like normal traffic and establishes VPN connections in a specific and unique way that avoids alerting internet filters.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to streaming, ProtonVPN works great. It's really fast and helps you watch shows which are not even available in your locality. ProtonVPN works with Amazon Prime video, Disney+, HBO max, Pluto tv and Netflix. The main thing you need to know that the free plan of ProtonVPN doesn't support streaming.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://go.getproton.me/aff_c?offer_id=26&aff_id=5186">ProtonVPN</a> has three plans which you can choose from, one free and other two paid. Here are the pricings for both the paid plans:</p>
                    <h4>VPN Plus</h4>
                    <p><b>Monthly plan</b>: $9.99</p>
                    <p><b>Yearly plan</b>: $5.99/month</p>
                    <p><b>2-years plan</b>: $4.99/month</p>
                    <h4>Proton Unlimited</h4>
                    <p><b>Monthly plan</b>: $11.99</p>
                    <p><b>Yearly plan</b>: $9.99/month</p>
                    <p><b>2-years plan</b>: $7.99/month</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that VPN Plus and Proton Unlimited have same features when it comes to VPN. You should choose Proton Unlimited plan only when you want to use Proton Mail or Proton Drive, else you should choose VPN plus if you're planning on using ProtonVPN only.</p>
                    <p>All-in-all, I would give ProtonVPN a rating of 8/10!</p>
