        <h2 style="margin-top: 2%;" id="step1">Sign up with an ecommerce builder</h2>
        <section class="step">
            <p>The first step is to sign up with an ecommerce builder. An ecommerce builder is an organisation which can help you make your ecommerce shop.</p>
            <p>For this purpose, we’ll use an organisation named Shopify. The reason behind using shopify is that it eases the process of building an ecommerce shop. It's beginner friendly and handles all the tech stuff like web hosting and payment processes.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 3%;">To get started, you just need to <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">go to Shopify</a> and click on <b>Sign Up</b>.</p>

The basic plan is good for you if you're just starting out. If you already are making money from offline and want to scale your business, then you should choose shopify plan.</p>
            <p>If you have a large business instead of a small one, then you should choose the advanced plan.</p>
            <a href="https://www.shopify.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="image2.webp" alt="list of available plans" width="100%"></a>

            </section>
            <h2 id="step3">Fine-tune your shop's setting</h2>
            <section class="step">
                <p>After building your shop, it's now time to fine-tune your shop's settings such as shipping process, different payment methods so that the customers can pay.</p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 140%; margin-bottom: 1%;">Set up a shipping process</h3>
                <p>Shipping is an important part of an ecommerce shop. This ensures that the customer gets the product for which he has paid for.</p>
                <p>To set up shipping you first need to click on <b>Settings</b> which is in the bottom left corner. Then click on <b>Shipping and delivery</b>.</p>
                <img src="image9.webp" alt="How to open shipping and delivery">
                <p>You can choose where to ship and how much you charge for shipping at checkout. You can also setup a processing time to show the delivery date to your customers. You can setup local delivery where you directly deliver to customers in the area.</p>
                <p>There are other features such as local pickup, shipping packages where you enter the data of the type of package will deliver. To learn more about shipping, you can go through <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping">this link</a>.</p>
                <h3>Set up payment methods</h3>
                <p>Setting up payment methods allows the customer to pay in different ways. This means that the customer would be able to buy your products using his desired payment method. This makes setting up payment methods an important aspect.</p>
                <p>To set up payment methods, you have to click on <b>Settings</b> which is in the bottom left corner. Then click on <b>Payments</b>.</p>
                <p>Then you have to click on <b>Choose a provider</b>. You will see a list of payment providers which you can choose to accept payments from customers. Different payment providers provide different payment methods.</p>
                <img src="image10.webp" alt="How to set up a payment provider">
                <p style="margin-top: 3%;">There are manual payment methods also such as Cash On Delivery(COD), Bank Deposit etc. You can find Manual Payment Methods if you scroll down a bit.</p>
            </section>
            <h2 id="step4">Obtain a domain name</h2>
            <section class="step">
                <p>The next and final step is to obtain a domain name. The reason why it is important is that it helps people find your shop easily and it creates a sense of security in people's mind. Therefore it's important to obtain the right domain name.</p>
                <p>To get a domain name, you need to go to a website that sells domain names. I would recommend <a href="https://godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>. The reason to use GoDaddy is that it integrates with shopify easily and it is also cheap compared to other websites.</p>
                <a href="https://godaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="image11.avif" alt="GoDaddy home page"></a>
                <p style="margin-top: 3%;">Now, you've to find the a good domain name for your store that hasn't been taken by someone. You've to choose a good name and good domain such as .com, .in etc.</p>
                <p>Once you have found a domain name that is good for your store, you can go ahead and purchase it.</p>
                <p>After that you've to go to the settings of your shop in shopify and click on <b>Domains</b>. Then you've to click on <b>Connect Existing Domain</b></p>
                <img src="image12.webp" alt="How to add a domain">
                <p style="margin-top: 3%;">Then you've to enter the name of the domain name that you've bought and then click <b>next</b>. If you've bought the domain name from GoDaddy, then you have to click on <b>Connect automatically</b>. You've to then login to GoDaddy.</p>
                <p>After logging in the domain name automatically connects to Shopify.</p>
                <img src="image13.webp" alt="How to add a domain name through GoDaddy">
                <p style="margin-top: 3%;">If you've bought the domain name from a different provider instead of GoDaddy, then you have to click on <b>Verify connection</b>. Since different providers have different ways to verify connection, therefore you should contact your provider for further info.</p>
                <img src="image14.webp" alt="How to add a domain name from a different provider">
                <p style="margin-top: 3%;">Congratulations! You've successfully made your own ecommerce shop.</p>
            </section>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1%;">Conclusion</h2>
            <section class="step" style="letter-spacing: .07rem; line-height:1.6;">
