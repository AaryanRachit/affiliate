So please move on to the next step only when you have built your store completely.</p> </section> <h2 id="step3">Fine-tune your shop's setting</h2> <section class="step"> <p>After building your shop, it's now time to fine-tune your shop's settings such as shipping process, different payment methods so that the customers can pay.</p> <h3>Set up a shipping process</h3> <p>Shipping is an important part of an ecommerce shop. This ensures that the customer gets the product for which he has paid for.</p> <p>To set up shipping you first need to click on <b>Settings</b> which is in the bottom left corner. Then click on <b>Shipping and delivery</b>.</p> <img src="/image9.0c520a4a.webp" alt="How to open shipping and delivery"> <p>You can choose where to ship and how much you charge for shipping at checkout. You can also setup a processing time to show the delivery date to your customers. You can setup local delivery where you directly deliver to customers in the area.</p> <p>There are other features such as local pickup, shipping packages where you enter the data of the type of package will deliver.

The reason why it is important is that it helps people find your shop easily and it creates a sense of security in people's mind. Therefore it's important to obtain the right domain name.</p> <p>To get a domain name, you need to go to a website that sells domain names. I would recommend <a href="https://godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>. The reason to use GoDaddy is that it integrates with shopify easily and it is also cheap compared to other websites.</p> <a href="https://godaddy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="/image11.97d3e414.avif" alt="GoDaddy home page"></a> <p style="margin-top:3%">Now, you've to find the a good domain name for your store that hasn't been taken by someone. You've to choose a good name and good domain such as .com, .in etc.</p> <p>Once you have found a domain name that is good for your store, you can go ahead and purchase it.</p> <p>After that you've to go to the settings of your shop in shopify and click on <b>Domains</b>. Then you've to click on <b>Connect Existing Domain</b></p> <img src="/image12.129fc9a2.webp" alt="How to add a domain"> <p style="margin-top:3%">Then you've to enter the name of the domain name that you've bought and then click <b>next</b>. If you've bought the domain name from GoDaddy, then you have to click on <b>Connect automatically</b>. You've to then login to GoDaddy.</p> <p>After logging in the domain name automatically connects to Shopify.</p> <img src="/image13.641e0cf1.webp" alt="How to add a domain name through GoDaddy"> <p style="margin-top:3%">If you've bought the domain name from a different provider instead of GoDaddy, then you have to click on <b>Verify connection</b>. Since different providers have different ways to verify connection, therefore you should contact your provider for further info.</p> <img src="/image14.f6267b86.webp" alt="How to add a domain name from a different provider"> <p style="margin-top:3%">Congratulations!
