            <p>If you like heavy-bass genres like EDM or Hip-Hop, you would likely want a headphone which can add more punch to your music. While there may be lots of headphones which promise to provide heavy bass but when you actually listen to them you get near-to-no bass. After testing over 50 headphones, we have come to a conclusion.</p>
            <p>Today, we will show 6 headphones which are good in both the quality and the price.</p>
        </intro>
        <h2>The 6 best headphones</h2>
        <steps class="step">
        <p>Here are the 6 best headphones which you would love to listen from.</p>
        <allst>

            </ol>
        </allst>
        </steps>
        <h2 id="step1">Sony WH-1000XM4</h2>
        <section class="step">
            <!-- <img src="imag1.jpg" alt="Sony WH-1000XM4"> -->
            <p>The best headphone that I have come across with powerful bass is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0863TXGM3?th=1">Sony WH-1000XM4</a>. I have tested this headphone myself and it really provides bass-heavy sound that delivers extra thumpy sound which is great if you listen to genres like funks or dupstep. If you are the one who prefers custom sound profile, then you can use the sound equalizer feature on this headphone to suit your tastes. Along with that, you also get high resolution audio since it has Sony's proprietary codec which most Sony headphones don't have.</p>
            <p>If you want a headphone which has a good battery life, then you should choose this one. It has a battery life of 34 hours on a single full charge which ensures that you don't have to worry about charging it frequently. It also provides you a very comfortable fit which helps you to listen for longer periods of time. In addition to that, you get Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) to help out block any background that disturbs you and I must say that its ANC is very powerful. It has the ability to supress upto 32 decibels of the total background noise. Previously I had some problems with my headphone not connecting to multiple devices, but that's not the case with this headphone. With it's dual connection technology, it can connect to upto 2 devices at a time.</p>
            <p>The actual price of this headphone is $385 but you can get it for just $348 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0863TXGM3?th=1">Amazon</a> with the same quality.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 id="step2">Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless</h2>
        <section class="step">
            <!-- <img src="imag2.jpg" alt="Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless"> -->
            <p>If you want a headphone which is more affordable without losing to many features, then you should definitely check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Wireless-Headphones-Crystal-Clear/dp/B0B6GHW1SX?th=1">Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless</a>. With this headphone, you get decent amount of bass and sound quality. This headphone also has 3-band EQ if you prefer different kind of sound profile.</p>
            <p>With this headphone you can get upto 62 hours of continuous playback, which is 200% more battery life than the previous headphone that we have discussed. It provides you with a comfortable fit to make sure that you can wear it for long sessions. You also have Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on this headphone which may not as much effective as Sony WH-1000XM4 but it can still supress background noises very well, which makes it a good choice at places at office where there is too much noise and disturbance. Just like the previous headphone, it supports multi-device pairing, meaning that you can connect it with up to 2 devices at a time. All-in-all, it's value for money.</p>
            <p>If you want this headphone then you can get it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Wireless-Headphones-Crystal-Clear/dp/B0B6GHW1SX?th=1">Amazon</a> for just $287.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 id="step3">Skullcandy Crusher Evo Wireless</h2>
        <section class="step">
        <!-- <img src="imag3.jpg" alt="Skullcandy Crusher Evo Wireless"> -->
        <p>If you want a headphone at a mid-range price that can provide intense bass and meet your needs, then you can choose <a href="https://www.skullcandy.in/shop/headphones/wireless-headphones/crusher-evo-sensory-bass-headphones-with-personal-sound/">Skullcandy Crusher Evo Wireless</a>. With this headphone, you get a haptic bass slider which adds extra thump or vibrations to your music. When set to high, the sound is bass boosted by a lot. It makes you feel that your skull is vibrating. This makes it great for listening to genres like EDM and Hip-Hop. The only thing that you don't get with this headphone is the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC).</p>
        <p>This headphone can go upto 35 hours of continuous playback on a single full charge, which is good enough for long sessions. It also provides you with a comfortable fit that helps you wear it for long periods of time without getting any pain. As discussed earlier, this headphone doesn't block that much sound.</p>
        <p>You can get this headphone for $200 on <a href="https://www.skullcandy.com/crusher-evo-wireless-headphones/">Skullcandy</a>'s official site but you can get it for just $150 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Wireless-Over-Ear-Headphone-Adjustable-Technology/dp/B08FCGH2RL?th=1">Amazon</a> with the same quality.</p>

        <h2 id="step4">Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless</h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth-Traveling/dp/B0B5VHRX7F?th=1">Anker soundcore space Q45 Wireless</a> is a headphone which has adaptive Noise Cancellation instead of ANC presets. This means that it can automatically adjust the noise cancellation according to your environment. This feature is very useful for me since I don't have to change the noise cancelling intensity everytime. You can switch to manual control also if you want to have more control over the noise cancellation intensity.</p>
        <p>Moreover, you can use this headphone for upto 50 hours when ANC is on or 65 hours when the ANC is off, which can be helpful when you're travelling and there is no means of charging.

It supports dual connection technology, allowing you to connect to upto two devices at a time. It provides a very comfortable fit and harmonious design too.</p>
