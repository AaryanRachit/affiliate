        </steps>
        <h2 id="way1">Affiliate Marketing</h2>
        <section class="step">
            <a href="https://www.shopify.com/in/affiliates"><img src="imag5.webp" alt="Shopify affiliate program"></a>
            <p style="margin-top: 2.5%;">The first way to make money is <b>Affiliate Marketing</b>. Affiliate Marketing means to promote other companys' products in exchange of some commision that the company is willing to pay. The main advantage of using this method is that it requires very less money to get started.</p>
            <p>To get started, you've to create a website or an account on any convenient platform like social media etc where you can easily promote the products of the company. There, you've to write description of the product that you want to sell. This way people can see and possibly buy the product using your link.</p>
            <p>Now, you have to apply to the affiliate program of the company whose product you're promoting. Keep in mind that some companies don't have these kinds of programs. So if they don't have one, then you have to promote other companys' products and apply to their affiliate program (if they have one).</p>
            <p>After getting into the affiliate program, you will provided custom links which you have to use in your post or website. You'll get commision only if a person buys the product through this custom link and not from any other link. After every 30 days or so you'll be paid based on the commision you have made.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 id="way2">Sell products online</h2>
        <section class="step">
            <a href="https://hostinger.com"><img src="imag4.webp" alt="Hostinger-website-builder"></a>
            <p style="margin-top: 2.5%;"><b>Selling products online</b> is also a good way to make money. You can sell products to multiple sales channels like Amazon, Ebay, Walmart etc or you can make your own shop and sell the products there. Selling products online can be done in two ways -</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Doing an Ecommerce business</b> - When doing an ecommerce business, you are both the manufacturer and the seller which means that you've to manufacture the products and then sell those to the customers. In ecommerce business the profit levels are high but the startup costs are also high.</li>
                <li><b>Doing a dropshipping business</b> - When doing a dropshipping business, you are only the seller which means that you sell the products from the manufacturer to the customers. In dropshipping business the startup costs are low but the profit levels are also low.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both ways can be done by selling the products through your own shop or through multiple sales channels.</p>
            <p>To make your own shop you can use <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> and then host it on the internet using <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/?REFERRALCODE=1NOOPS89">Hostinger</a> or you can just use <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a> if you want a easier process of making a shop. Then you've to list the products on your shop to start selling.</p>
            <p>You can also list your products on multiple e-commerce businesses like <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.walmart.com/">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sl/sell" target="_blank">E-bay</a> etc. The benefit you get by listing the products on these businesses is that nearly everything is handled by the company whether it be returning an item, customer support or storage warehouses. But remember that these companies take good percentage of the total revenue.</p>
            <p>This was all about how to list your products on the internet for sale. But now you've to promote to people and tell them about your products. This can be done through many ways like E-mail marketing, Creating your own blog post or running facebook or google ads. The content inside it should be something like coupon codes or free products on their first order. This way you will get more customers and eventually generate more revenue.</p>
